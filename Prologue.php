	<p>In the year 2243, adaptable permanent colonies have been developed and are starting to be deployed around the solar system. Although the colonies take 5 years before they're habitable for humans, some people have decided to travel to the planets with the colonies to try to speed up the process. The colonists on Venus were geneticists, the colonists on Ganymede were transhumanists, the colonists on Titan were ecologists, the colonists on Titania were biologists, and the colonists on Triton were technologists. Earth's moon has been renamed to Luna due to the citizens that live on the outer moons felt that no singular object should be given the name 'moon.' The order that other worlds were colonized is Luna, Mars, Ceres, Ganymede, Callisto, Europa, Titan, Titania, Triton, Pluto, Charon, Venus, and Mercury.</p>
	<p>In 2457, each planet in the solar system has been colonized, and the genealogies of the separate planets started into their own races due to their individual living styles and the circumstances of their planet. After many legal battles, it had been decreed by Solar law that the native inhabitants of each planet were each of their own race.</p>
	<p>In 2608, the Jovian, Saturnal, and Plutonian space programs decided to search star systems for signs of other intelligent life forms. Their first probes were sent out in 2625 to Gliese 687 and Gliese 674. The probes would take 600 years to arrive there, as although those two stars are only 15 light years away, they were only going 2.5% the speed of light. <!--///.--> </p>
	<p>Planets have begun creating mages, people who can bend a specific phase of matter, in order to be used as a police force. There are four classes: pyrokinesis, aerokinesis, liquikinesis, and terrinesis.</p>
	<p>Solar time measurements have been adopted as the standard measurements for interplanetary communication, where 1 Solar Year is roughly equal to 60 Earth years.</p>
